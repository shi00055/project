Fistly, i create index.html, product.html,about.html,contact.html,index.js and style.css to build my web portfolio. index.html is my homepage, my homepage have 6 parts. There are navigation, main picture, our products, about us, contact us and footer. The most difficult part is my navgation and products part. I want to create a special navgation, when i scroll it, it will change color. fristly i used write "dominos-master" method to try. But i use"addEventListener"to change it, but i try a lots of times,it doesn't work. And then i google it,google said I can use" $(document).ready(function()$(window).scroll(function()". But this process is not very smoothï¼ŒI follow the method on Google, but it still doesn't work. I don't know why. I didn't give up, i countin search it, finally, i find "window.onscroll" is work. And for products part, I want to use "deck-of-cards" to try, the picture is work, but the text is doesn't work, i can't push text on the top, so i search again, and i find i aslo can use css to do this, so i use css to do this part. And for my about, contact and footer part, it is not very difficult, i can do it quickly. Accroding to this homework, i learn a lot of knowlege, I reviewed a lot of knowledge I have learned this semester. For example, image response and "addEventListener".
